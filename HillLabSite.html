        </div>
        <p style="font-family:  'Josefin Sans'; font-weight: 300; font-size: 13pt">The Hill Lab at the Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth seeks to push the technological boundaries of what can be achieved diagnostically using human breath. The lungs represent a window into the rest of the body, receiving half of all blood pumped by the heart with each heartbeat. Our survival relies on the ability of the lungs to exchange metabolites and waste products in the blood with incoming nutrients (namely oxygen) from the air. Thus, we believe that breath can tell us a great deal about what is going on within the body, and diagnosing disease using breath is a desirable goal, given the non-invasiveness of breath collection.

Over the past few years, the Hill group has published a series of studies in the mouse model demonstrating that breath can be used to identify the etiology of bacterial lung infections. The breath of mice whose lungs are acutely infected with a variety of bacterial pathogens (<i>Haemophilus influenza</i>, <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i>, <i>Legionella pneumophila</i>, <i>Moraxella catarrhalis</i>, <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, or <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i>) contain a complement of volatile compounds that are specific to the infection, with 50-60% of the volatile molecules in the “breathprint” coming from the murine host, and the remaining molecules originating from bacterial metabolism during pathogenesis. In addition, using the breath from infected mice, our group has shown that different strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa can be distinguished from one another, as can methicillin-resistant and methicillin-sensitive strains of Staphylococcus aureus. We have barely begun to scratch the surface of the development of breath as a diagnostic medium, and our lab is applying some of the most sophisticated analytical tools available to determine the applications and limits of breath analysis.</p>

        <p style="font-family:  'Josefin Sans'; font-weight: 300;">Jane was born in Sydney, Australia. She was raised in rural New South Wales and her high school years were spent in Grenfell, the birthplace of the famous Australian poet Henry Lawson. After completing two years of Chemical Engineering at the University of New South Wales, Jane moved to the US, whereupon she finished her BS in Chemical Engineering and an MS in Environmental Management and Policy at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. After running a small bioremediation waste clean-up company in upstate New York for a few years, Jane returned to university to learn more about the fascinating world of microorganisms. She completed her PhD at Yale University with Water Treatment Technologist Menachem Elimelech and worked with Biotechnologist Jordan Peccia at Yale for her post-doctoral experience. Jane is faculty works at the Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth, where she heads a Biotechnology group that targets infectious diseases, from fundamental questions about pathogenesis to the development of diagnostic tools. In her spare time, Jane likes to play tennis, hike with her dog, garden, skijor, read books and poetry, play music, travel ... and think about microbes. When possible, she would like to continue learning how to kitesurf ... even though it scares her half to death.</p>
